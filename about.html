            <h2> About </h2>
            <p> Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1997. They consist of vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, guitarist
            Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, drummer Will Champion and manager Phil Harvey. They initially met at University
            College London, calling themselves Big Fat Noises and changing to Starfish, before settling on the current name.
            
            After independently releasing an extended play, Safety (1998), Coldplay signed with Parlophone in 1999. The band's debut
            album, Parachutes (2000), included their breakthrough single "Yellow" and received a Brit Award for British Album of the
            Year, a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and a Mercury Prize nomination. Their second album, A Rush of
            Blood to the Head (2002), won the same accolades and included the single "Clocks", which won a Grammy Award for Record
            of the Year. Their third album, X&Y (2005), which completed what the band considered a trilogy, was nominated for the
            Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. Their fourth album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), won Best Rock
            Album. Both albums were the best-selling of their respective years, topping the charts in over 30 countries. Viva la
            Vida was also nominated for Album of the Year, while its title track became the first single by a British group to
            simultaneously reach number one in the United Kingdom and United States in the 21st century.</p>

            <p> Coldplay further diversified their sound over their next five studio albums, the most recent being Music of the Spheres
            (2021). Each album presented a unique theme and added new musical styles to the band's original repertoire, including
            electronica, ambient, pop, R&B, classical and progressive rock. They are also known for "euphoric" and "immersive" live
            performances, which NME said are when the band "come alive and make the most sense". In 2018, a career-spanning
            documentary directed by Mat Whitecross was released in cinemas to celebrate the band's 20th anniversary.</p>
